# AI Contribution Guidelines 

This file defines architectural and engineering standards that must be
followed when modifying this repository.

The goal is to keep this repo clean, intentional, and production-quality
as it evolves.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Clean Code First

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Small, composable functions.
- No unnecessary abstraction.
- No premature optimization.
- Avoid hidden magic unless explicitly intentional (e.g., command discovery).

If something feels hacky, it probably is.

---

### 2. Always Write Tests

- New behavior must include tests.
- Structural changes must include test updates.
- CLI commands should be testable without invoking subprocesses.
- Prefer unit tests over integration tests unless required.

No feature is complete without tests.

---

### 3. No Technical Debt

- Do not leave TODOs without implementing them.
- Do not introduce placeholder code unless explicitly requested.
- Do not defer refactors that are necessary for correctness or clarity.
- Remove dead code immediately.

If the structure needs improvement, fix it properly.

---

### 4. No Backwards Compatibility Before 1.0.0

Until version 1.0.0:

- Breaking changes are allowed.
- Refactors are encouraged.
- Internal APIs may change freely.
- Command interfaces may evolve.

Clarity and correctness matter more than stability at this stage.

---

## Architectural Expectations

- Commands must be modular.
- Command discovery must remain explicit and understandable.
- Shared state must flow through a Context object.
- Filesystem behavior must be predictable and testable.
- Avoid global state.

---

## Testing Structure

- Tests should mirror the `src/level` directory structure when practical.
- Core modules (e.g. `level/config.py`) should have corresponding tests (e.g. `tests/test_config.py`).
- Command modules (e.g. `level/commands/config.py`) should be tested under `tests/commands/`.
- Avoid flat, ambiguous test naming as the project grows.

---

## Style

- Type hints are required for all public functions.
- Use dataclasses for structured data.
- Avoid large files (>300 lines) when possible.
- Logging should use the project logger, not print(), except in CLI output.

---

## Philosophy

This is a career operating system, not a script collection.

Design for:
- Long-term maintainability
- Explicit structure
- Strong separation of concerns
- Intentional evolution

Avoid shortcuts.
Avoid entropy.
